#Data Collection: 
  Gather a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam (ham). You can find such datasets online or create your own by labeling messages manually.

#Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Split each message into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Convert all words to lowercase to ensure consistency.
Removing Punctuation: Remove any punctuation marks as they may not carry significant meaning in this context.
Stopword Removal: Remove common stopwords like 'and', 'the', 'is', etc. as they don't contribute much to the classification.
Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form to normalize the vocabulary. For example, 'running' and 'ran' might both be stemmed to 'run'.
Feature Extraction:

Bag of Words (BoW): Represent each message as a vector where each element corresponds to the count of a particular word in the message.
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Similar to BoW but gives more weight to less common words.
Word Embeddings: Represent words in a continuous vector space to capture semantic meanings.
Model Selection:

Naive Bayes: A simple yet effective probabilistic classifier.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Can handle high-dimensional data well and works well for binary classification tasks.
Logistic Regression: Another commonly used classifier for binary classification tasks.
Decision Trees / Random Forests: Can capture non-linear relationships between features.
Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the chosen model(s) on the training set.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model(s) on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model(s) to optimize performance.

Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to classify incoming SMS messages as spam or ham.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Regularly monitor the model's performance and update it if necessary to adapt to changing patterns in spam messages.

Optional Enhancements:

Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models for improved performance.
Deep Learning Models: Experiment with deep learning architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for potentially better performance, especially with word embeddings.
